# ATW-Polar
This is an Matlab code for seismic polarization analysis in time domain. There are mainly three different windows: constant window, center frequency window and optimal variable window.

SeismicPolarFilter:Example of real microseismic polarization filtering

AziInc:Examples of azimuth and incidence angles calculated for different windows

Part of the polarization calculation refers to PolarGUI (Li et al, 2021), which can be found in https://github.com/lhl-cdut/PolarGUI.
